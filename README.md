# CodeReek

CodeReek is real-time error tracking and quality monitoring software that gives you insight into production deployments and information to reproduce, fix crashes and etc..

Following are some of the prominent features of CodeReek:

* Get notifications via email, sms, or chat when new errors occur or old ones resurface.
* If things break, you’ll know where errors are happening, how often they happen, and who is affected.
* Know what’s breaking and how to reproduce the problem, without waiting for user reports.
* Automatically prompt users for feedback so they know that you know things aren’t working.
* Reach out to affected users to let them know they’ve experienced an error and that help is on the way.
* View actual code in stack traces, including support for source maps.
* See the error’s url, parameters, and session information.
* Filter noisy traces with app, framework, and raw error views.

CodeReek is being developed using the infrastructure of sentry.io.
